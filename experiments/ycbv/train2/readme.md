# Training

From @TontonTremblay

This is the training code used for the NViSII [paper](). You can also use this training script on the training data generated by the training script in `scripts/nvisii_data_gen/`

```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 train.py --network dope --epochs 2 --batchsize 10 --outf tmp/ --data ../nvisii_data_gen/output/output_example/
```

There is an accompanying dataset you can also use to train DOPE on the meat can with the shiny top. [link here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q5VLnlt1gu2pKIAcUo9uzSyWw1nGlSF8/view?usp=sharing).

Use dope_env.yaml to create a conda environment for training DOPE.
